traktor keyboard firmware
=========================

This is for the board with a Pro Micro in it!

Build it:

    make

Then upload:

    sleep 5; make program

Controller reset can be triggered via boot magic `LShift + RShift + Pause`
(`Pause` is left layer button + enter). Reset can also be triggered by
shorting RST to GND.
